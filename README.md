# xSDR6000
## Mac Client for the FlexRadio (TM) 6000 series software defined radios.
###      (see Evolution below for radio versions that are supported)




##         xSDR600 is starting to be useable for some even though it's far from complete.

I want to focus on "stability" for the next few releases. I need feedback from users. If you see a bug or experience a crash, please take a minute to report it to:

douglas.adams@me.com

If possible, include a copy of the log(s) found in:

~/Library/Application Support/net.k3tzr.xSDR6000/Logs/

Thank you for your help! üëç





### Built on:

*  macOS 10.15.6 Beta (19G46c)
*  Xcode 11.5 (11E608c)
*  Swift 5.2


## Usage

Provides functionality similar to the FlexRadio (TM) SmartSDR (TM) app.

**NOTE: This app is a "work in progress" and is not fully functional**  

Portions of this app do not work and changes may be added from time to time which will break all or part of this app.  


## Builds

Compiled RELEASE builds will be created at relatively stable points, please use them.  

If you require a DEBUG build you will have to build from sources. 


## Comments / Questions

Please send any bugs / comments / questions to douglas.adams@me.com
